Final Project

Some difficulties I encourtered was trying to link the styling part of the website to Github. I managed to find someone else online who had struggled with that too, and was able to receive positive feedback. Also, sometimes my css file would not update. I realized I had to clear my cache on google chrome. 
Also, the border took a while to fix, because it wasn't showing up properly specifically the drop down. 

Overall, I had a lot of fun making this, but it took much longer to get the basics done on the website than I thought. This was probably because I've never coded before this class, and I've never made my own website before!
