# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Musical Web Express

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that finds music based on what you input as your favorite genre. The link leads to a spot on the website of a piece of sheet music or video.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will ask the user for input to find out their favorite genre. Then, the website will direct them to sheet music or a video related to that. The user may also provide commentary or opinions based on how the user responds to the question. I may try to link a video of me playing cello for some of them. In addition, the website will look professional(or as good as I can get it with limited skills).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A decent looking website that takes a user input and correctly directs them to a different link or place on the website. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish taking the userâ€™s input and redirecting them, but also providing more variations of responses to each input. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be if the website looked professional, correctly directed the user, and had various ways the user could interact with the website. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I'll have to learn how to set up a website and change the designs to make it look better. I'll also have to learn the basics of HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages will help to create an application to make the website. HTML will help link pages together. In addition, the Boostrap library will be used to help create a homepage. This will simplify the code a bit, so that CSS is not needed. Finally, JavaScript will assit in the interactive component of the website.
