Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created the Website. I have added colors, text, and even a link that directs the user to another site. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to figure out how to take a user's input and direct them to the site I want. Also, I'm trying to figure out how to add an image as the background to improve how the site appears. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I'm having some difficulty figuring out how to position text the way I want it. I can center it, but I don't know how to move it down on the page. Also, the link after someone submits a response is failing to direct them to the correct webiste or any website at all. I did have some trouble originally figuring out what space to work on and how to get my website to open, but I figured it out.
