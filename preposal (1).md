# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A travel advertising website
An online game that asks Trivia questions
A bot that makes dad jokes when user interacts with character

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'm working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is there an example or two from past years you can share? I'm a little confused on how sophisticated this project is supposed to look.
